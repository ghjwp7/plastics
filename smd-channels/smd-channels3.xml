  <!-- SMD-channels data tables: Tape Data, Channel Specs, Parts to
       Make; by jiw 22 Feb 2019

       Each <table ... /> record contains the following: a set of
       table attribute values (see list below); a `columndata`
       section; a `row` record for each row of the table; and
       (optionally) a `style` entry.

       Columndata: This section specifies names and characteristics
       of table columns.  It contains a `column` entry for each
       column of the current table.  See attributes list, below.

       Row records: Each of these is a list of attribute keys and
       corresponding attribute values - data to fill one row.
       
       Styles:  Each <style part='x' /> entry should have x as a valid
       cascading style sheet part.  Style entry parts for a table are
       concatenated together (in no particular order) as they occur.
       This blob of styles is applied via a statement like
       tab.setStyleSheet(blob), where tab is current table.  Eligible
       style targets include QTableWidget, QHeaderView, and
       QTableCornerButton.


       Table attributes are:  tab, name, cue, wpix, hpix.
       tab:    an id number (1,2,3...) for the table.  When appended to
               string 'Table' should form a valid python identifier.
       name:   the name of the table
       cue:    a string the app software can treat as a table ID
       wpix:   Minimum allowed width of table display pane; pixels
       hpix:   Minimum allowed height of table display pane; pixels


       Column attributes are:
       col:  column number.  Column appearance order is given by
             sorting col values into alphanumeric order; eg, 1, 10, 2...
       cue:  a string the app software can use as a variable name
       name: column name
       fmt:  data-type letter, with values f, i, r, or s,
             indicating float, integer, radio-button or string.
	     (In this framework, at most one radio-button per
	     table is selected at any given time.
       tip:  tooltip to be displayed in the app when the column
             name is hovered upon.

<table tab='1'  cue='tapes'  name='Tape Data'  wpix='600'  hpix='220'  >
    <!-- The `Tape Data` table: This data should be obtained from part
         spec sheets or from measurements of tape.

       Re names and nicknames: These are used later in the `Parts to
       Make` table to say what set of specs to use.  If multiple tapes
       have the same name or nick and are called for by the duplicated
       name, `Parts to Make` will choose one of them in some undefined
       way.  cue, name, and nick strings are case sensitive and may
       appear in any order within records.

       Re overhangs: Parts tapes typically have more clearance along
       one edge than the other.  Call these the `wide` and `narrow`
       edges.  You can use Overhang1 for one of the clearance widths,
       and Overhang2 for the other.  Overhang1 is used for `left`
       sides of units produced, and Overhang2 for the other.

       Alternate overhangs: `Over.1 alt` and `Over.2 alt` are
       overhangs used in setback (or cutout) sections of units.  The
       length of the cutout section is cap length - 2*(end length) or
       0, whichever is larger.
       
       The narrow clearance usually is less than a millimeter,
       say 0.8 mm, while the wide clearance typically is over 3 mm.
       An overhang that is too narrow is undesirable; 3D printing a
       lip of 0.8 mm width results in less-secure tape holding than
       printing one twice as wide, so it is reasonable to use a wider
       overhang when feasible.  An overhang that is too wide, on the
       other hand, makes it more difficult to load tape into the
       channel and more difficult to smoothly remove the transparent
       top cover tape when dispensing parts, besides interfering with
       lifting parts out of their wells in the tape.  While 3.5 mm
       wide-side overhang often is feasible, 2 mm usually is adequate.

  <table tab='2' cue='rails'  name='Unit Specs'  wpix='640'  hpix='100'  >
    <!-- This contains guide channel data items reflecting user
         preferences or needs, such as overall lengths, cutaway
         lengths, post diameters and spacing, etc.  These data
         elements need to be tape- and self-consistent but otherwise
         are free. Each row represents an alternate set of specs.

      Data elements in this table can be set per user preference.
      Numbers consistent with tape type and reality should be used.
      For example, CapWide - overhang widths > PostOD > PostID; that
      is, the outer diameter of a cylinder should be greater than its
      inner diameter (or it will have no walls).  The post should fit
      between outer edges of support legs, which are inset from cap
      edges by specified overhang widths (or it will interfere with
      tape path).  Overhangs wider than cap widths will mush parts
      together.

      For another example, CutoutLen == CapLen - 2*EndLen; that is,
      the length of side with no overhang depends on Cap Length and
      cap End-Length.  If CutoutLen is negative, there is no cutout.
      If EndLen is zero or negative, CutoutLen equals overall length.
      If end-padding or an overhang is negative, legs will extend
      unsupported beyond the cap, a 3D printing problem case.

  <table tab='3'  cue='makes'  name='Units to Make'  wpix='640'  hpix='100' > 
    <!-- This lists which side-combinations are to be produced, plus
         estimated unit volumes.  Each row of the table (except first
         and last) contributes a wide side to one unit, and a narrow
         side to the next unit.  The first row contributes a narrow
         side, and the last a wide side.

         Example: Suppose the rows list types a, b, c, d.  The list of
         contributed sides is a.2, b.1, b.2, c.1, c.2, d.1, in which
         .1 denotes an Overhang1 side, and .2 an Overhang2 side.
         Units are made by grouping the contributed sides in pairs:
         [a.2,b.1] [b.2,c.1] [c.2,d.1], where [p,q] specifies the left
         and right sides of one unit.
	 
         Channel ordering may affect unit volumes slightly, because the leg
         height of a unit is the maximum of the heights of joined
         types.  You may wish to add, move, or modify rows or specs
         for efficiency. (Eg make units in order by increasing height)

         The number of units made is one less than the number of types
	 listed in this table, since two sides are skipped at first and
	 last rows.  (Typically, use `null` as first and last types.)

         The currently-selected specs line from Table 2 is used to
	 produce units, whenever the Produce button is clicked. -->
