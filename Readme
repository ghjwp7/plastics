Files related to Making 3D models with SolidPython & OpenSCAD

This repository contains files like the following:

exec-on-change --- Shell script that uses inotifywait to detect when
  a program changes; to automatically run a SolidPython program each
  time you save the program.

jgenArg.py --- Module to simplify fetching program argument values
  with defaults.  Used by gen-flanged-tube
  
gen-channel-asm2.py --- SolidPython program to generate channels and
  rails that can be assembled to make dispensers for reel-supplied SMD
  parts
  
gen-flanged-tube3.py --- SolidPython program to generate a flanged and
  threaded tube-connector, and a threaded ring to hold the connector
  in place when bulkhead mounted.  Illustrates making mating threads
